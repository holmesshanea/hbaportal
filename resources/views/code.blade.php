                <p>
                    Homeward Bound Adirondacks® (HBA) Nature Retreats are multi-day, peer-based experiences designed to
                    support veterans in reconnecting with themselves, one another, and the natural world. These retreats
                    combine outdoor experiences, shared reflection, and quiet time in nature to help veterans slow down,
                    find grounding, and explore healthier ways of managing the lasting effects of military service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HBA operates on a peer-to-peer model, and many staff and volunteers are veterans themselves. While
                    retreats are often enjoyable and include moments of connection, laughter, and time outdoors, they
                    also carry a serious and intentional focus. Conversations and experiences may touch on topics such as
                    trauma, PTSD, MST, anxiety, depression, isolation, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Participants
                    should be aware that some discussions may be emotionally challenging.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A licensed Mental Health (MH) provider is present at all Nature Retreats and is available should any
                    participant feel triggered, overwhelmed, or in need of additional support. Participation in retreat
                    activities is challenge-by-choice—veterans are encouraged to engage fully, but no one is ever
                    required to participate in any activity or discussion they are not comfortable with. This is your
                    time, and your experience should move at your own pace.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At Homeward Bound Adirondacks®, integrity is fundamental to all that we do. By registering for and
                    participating in an HBA Nature Retreat, you agree to uphold the following expectations for yourself
                    and any accompanying guests:
                </p>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                    <li>Treat fellow veterans, HBA teammates, volunteers, service providers, and guests with respect, courtesy, and compassion.</li>
                    <li>Discriminating, harassing, threatening, or sexually offensive behavior—verbal or non-verbal—is strictly prohibited.</li>
                    <li>Respect personal boundaries and differing experiences, perspectives, and coping styles.</li>
                    <li>Always exercise reasonable care for your own safety and the safety of others, and follow all safety instructions, guidelines, and practices provided by HBA staff, facilitators, and retreat partners.</li>
                    <li>Misconduct is unacceptable, including aggressive behavior, intimidation, unwanted physical contact, horseplay, or damage to property.</li>
                    <li>Criminal behavior or activity will not be tolerated.</li>
                    <li>The use or possession of illicit controlled substances, illegal drugs, or alcohol is strictly prohibited during retreats.</li>
                    <li>Failure to adhere to this Code of Conduct may result in removal from the retreat, ineligibility for future HBA programs, or unenrollment as a participant.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If at any time you feel uncertain, uncomfortable, or have concerns—whether for yourself or another
                    participant—please notify an HBA staff member immediately. We are committed to maintaining a safe,
                    respectful, and supportive environment for all who attend.

                    These Nature Retreats are funded by the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant.
                    Because this program is supported in whole or in part by financial assistance from the Federal
                    Government, HBA is required under 38 C.F.R. Part 50 to provide the following notice:
                </p>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                    <li>HBA may not discriminate against you based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.</li>
                    <li>HBA may not require you to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities (including worship, religious instruction, or proselytization). Participation in any such activity must be purely voluntary.</li>
                    <li>You may report violations of these protections, including denial of services or benefits, by contacting the VA Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Team using the contact information provided by HBA.</li>
                    <li>If you would like information about other organizations that provide similar services in your area, including federally funded organizations, that information can also be obtained through the contacts above.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This written notice must be provided prior to enrollment or receipt of services whenever practicable.
                    In emergency clinical situations, notice may be provided at the earliest available opportunity.

                <p>
                    Homeward Bound Adirondacks® (HBA) Peer-to-Peer Events are one-day, non-clinical gatherings designed to
                    foster camaraderie, mutual support, and connection among veterans. These events provide an
                    opportunity for veterans to spend time together, share experiences if they choose, build
                    relationships, and enjoy activities in a supportive and respectful environment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Peer-to-Peer Events are not therapy, counseling, or clinical treatment. Participation is voluntary,
                    and veterans are encouraged—but never required—to engage in conversations or activities at their own
                    comfort level. The focus is on connection, shared experience, and community, rather than structured
                    healing or clinical intervention.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HBA operates on a peer-to-peer model, and many staff and volunteers facilitating these events are
                    veterans themselves. While these events may naturally involve meaningful conversations, participants
                    should be mindful that everyone arrives with different experiences, boundaries, and readiness to
                    share. Respect for personal space, perspectives, and limits is essential.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At Homeward Bound Adirondacks®, integrity is fundamental to all that we do. By participating in an
                    HBA Peer-to-Peer Event, you agree to uphold the following expectations for yourself and any
                    accompanying guests:

                    <li>Discriminating, harassing, threatening, or sexually offensive behavior—verbal or non-verbal—is strictly prohibited.</li>
                    <li>Always exercise reasonable care for your own safety and the safety of others, and follow any instructions, guidelines, or safety practices provided by HBA staff or volunteers.</li>
                    <li>Misconduct is unacceptable, including aggressive behavior, unwanted physical contact, intimidation, or damage to property.</li>
                    <li>Criminal behavior or activity will not be tolerated.</li>
                    <li>The use or possession of illicit controlled substances or illegal drugs is strictly prohibited. Alcohol policies, if applicable to a specific event, will be clearly communicated in advance and must be followed.</li>
                    <li>Failure to adhere to this Code of Conduct may result in removal from the event, ineligibility for future HBA programs, or unenrollment as a participant.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If at any time you feel uncomfortable, uncertain, or have a concern, please reach out to an HBA staff
                    member or volunteer. We are here to ensure that all participants experience a safe, respectful, and
                    welcoming environment.

                    These Peer-to-Peer Events are supported by the New York State PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Veteran Peer Support
                    Program, which promotes veteran-to-veteran connection and support in a non-clinical setting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With your cooperation and commitment to these standards, we can continue to honor, support, and
                    strengthen the veteran community we serve.
